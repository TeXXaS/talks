# Links, references, materials - for both coroutines, and green/virtual threads + some other things...


- [What every programmer should know about the memory](https://lwn.net/Articles/250967/?rss=1)
Just read it. You don't need to understand everything, nor remember - just overall picuture, relation between different types of memory...

- [Project Loom, virtual threads](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/going-inside-javas-project-loom-and-virtual-threads)
Oracle blog.
- [Spring Framework, and virtual threads](https://spring.io/blog/2022/10/11/embracing-virtual-threads)

- [KT Academy](https://kt.academy/article/cc-under-the-hood)
My main source of knowledge about Kotlin, its coroutines.
   
- [JetBrains speaks about virtual threads](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/kotlinconf-2023/Coroutines%20and%20Loom%20Behind%20The%20Scenes.pdf)
Just in case - JetBrains are authors of Kotlin, so their perspective on this "competition" is quite interesting.
